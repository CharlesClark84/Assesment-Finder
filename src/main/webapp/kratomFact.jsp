        <span class="blue">What is kratom:</span>
        Kratom is the tropical tree Mitragyna speciosa native to Southeast Asia Thailand and Malaysia, with leaves that contain compounds that can have psychotropic, mind-altering effects similar to an opioid.

        <span class="blue">How is kratom used:</span>
        Most people take kratom as a pill, capsule, or extract. Some people chew kratom leaves or brew the dried or powdered leaves as a tea. Sometimes the leaves are smoked or eaten in food.
        Kratom can cause effects similar to both opioids and stimulants. Two compounds in kratom leaves, mitragynine and 7-Î±-hydroxymitragynine, interact with opioid receptors in the brain, producing sedation, pleasure, and decreased pain, especially when users consume large amounts of the plant. Mitragynine also interacts with other receptor systems in the brain to produce stimulant effects. When kratom is taken in small amounts, users report increased energy, sociability, and alertness instead of sedation. However, kratom can also cause uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous side effects.

        <span class="blue">Risks of using:</span>
        Reported health effects of kratom use include sensitivity to sunburn, nausea, itching, sweating, dry mouth, constipation, increased urination and loss of appetite. Kratom by itself is not associated with fatal overdose, but commercial forms of the drug are sometimes laced with other compounds that have caused deaths.

        People who use kratom for long periods have experienced anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, dry mouth, frequent urination and constipation. Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusion, and confusion) have been reported at high doses. Like other opioids, kratom may cause dependence (feeling physical withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug), and some people have reported becoming addicted to kratom. Withdrawal symptoms include: muscle aches, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggression, emotional changes, runny nose and jerky movements.

        In recent years, some people have used kratom as an herbal alternative to medical treatment in attempts to control withdrawal symptoms and cravings caused by addiction to other opioids or to other addictive substances such as alcohol. There is no scientific evidence that kratom is effective or safe for this purpose.
