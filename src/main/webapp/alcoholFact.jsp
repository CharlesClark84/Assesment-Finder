       <span class="blue">Risks of using:</span>
       Alcohol lowers inhibitions and impairs judgment and coordination. It can also increase the incidence of aggressive or violent acts. Consuming large enough quantities in a short period of time or binge drinking, which is defined as 4-5 drinks in two hours or less, can cause alcohol poisoning. This often happens by choking on vomit, which leads to a lack of oxygen that causes suffocation.
       Prolonged, heavy use of alcohol can lead to addiction (alcoholism), liver and heart disease, and other health consequences such as a weakened immune system and increased risk of developing certain cancers
