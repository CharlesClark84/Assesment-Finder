    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might have tried to convince your loved one to go into rehab for years, but it hasn&apos;t worked. Your efforts might have even pushed your loved one away.
        But an intervention might be the tool you need to break through and achieve the goal you&apos;re after. An intervention creates a space to honestly and
        lovingly explain how your loved one&apos;s behavior is affecting you and how he has changed. Instead of nagging or talking in a resentful or angry way, this
        tactic focuses on feelings and creating awareness for the person who is addicted to drugs or alcohol. When a number of people come together and tell the
        person the same thing, it can really create awareness.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be beneficial to have a professional help run your intervention. A professional can guide the discussion, encourage the person to open up and can
        give helpful advice.  Do you know the differences between a 12 step call and an intervention? A drug intervention can help someone realize he is addicted
        and to what extent. Many people do not realize they are addicted; they simply think they enjoy drugs or alcohol, but don&apos;t realize it is taking over their
        lives.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are surrounded by other addicted people, so their behavior seems normal in comparison. During an intervention, they start to see how their lives
        have changed and how the drug has affected their family life, friend life and work life.</p>

    <h2 class="center"><span class="green">The Steps of Drug Intervention The following 9 steps can help you plan for and run your intervention</span></h2>

    <p><ol>
        <li><span class="blue">Stop enabling the person</span> by giving him money, making excuses for him, ignoring his drug problem, paying his bills and other means of enabling. This will only
            reward and encourage these behaviors. It won&apos;t encourage the person to stop.</li>

        <li><span class="blue">Plan the timing of your intervention</span>. If you can, try to talk to the person when he is not &quot;high&quot; and when everyone is calm and ready to discuss their feelings.</li>

        <li><span class="blue">Pick a time</span> when you can talk to the person in private, instead of in front of his friends or during an inconvenient time.</li>

        <li><span class="blue">Get the help of a professional</span> if you can. A counselor can help guide the discussion and can help the person with questions.
        During the intervention, be specific with your comments. Give specific examples of how the person&apos;s drug use has affected you.</li>

        <li><span class="blue">Show that you care</span>. Tell your loved one that you care about him and that&apos;s why you are doing this intervention. Express that you want to be there and that you
        want to support him in finding help.</li>

        <li><span class="blue">Express the consequences</span> of continuing his behavior. Let him know that you are no longer going to enable his drug use, and give specific examples of what will
        change. Let him know that this is not a punishment, but it is to protect yourself and to get the person to find help. You must follow through with whatever you
        say.</li>

        <li><span class="blue">Create a group</span>. Interventions work better when a whole group of people is saying the same thing, than if one or two is saying it. Enlist the help of friends,
        family members and even coworkers or employers to talk to the person. However, only choose people that will be supportive and loving.</li>

        <li><span class="blue">Listen</span>. Instead of bombarding the person, pay attention to what he has to say and if he has any questions. If he starts asking where he would go for treatment
        or similar questions, he is starting to reach out for help, which is a positive sign. Have him talk to a professional immediately to find the right program.</li>

        <li><span class="blue">If agreed to treatment, help them get there immediately</span>. If you wait, he might change his mind about going. You should already have some of his things
        packed for him and a plan to bring the person to a treatment program.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <h2 class="center"><span class="green">Top Reasons Interventions Fail</span></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Family members are instructed to stop enabling and create a firm bottom line. That means absolute consequences for the addict&apos;s behavior if he refuses
        treatment. It&apos;s sad to say that the addict&apos;s family usually becomes sick in their own way and allows the addict to keep using by helping him. Parents
        or spouses don&apos;t want to see Johnny living in the street, so they pay his way or let him live at home. They fix things to keep him out of jail. As long
        as an addict or alcoholic can continue using with minimal consequence, they will never stop. No addict wants to stop until they have to. Tough love is
        absolutely needed.</li>

    <li>The family didn&apos;t hold their &quot;bottom line&quot; when their son wanted to leave the center before his treatment was complete. The parents gave in and bought their child a
        bus ticket home. This was the third time they allowed their son to leave while detoxing, but also the last time. Their son died of an overdose a day after returning home.</li>

   <li> Family members must be stronger than the addict.
    Not being educated about what is required to make an intervention successful. This is an areas where a professional is your best bet, since you can&apos;t teach
        yourself what you don&apos;t know. If family and friends together end up using the same nagging and tactics they&apos;ve always used, chances are ganging up won&apos;t
        make any difference. Quantity has no bearing if the family doesn&apos;t know what works and what doesn&apos;t. Trained professionals educate the family before the
       intervention, making the effort worthwhile instead of another act of futility.</li>


    <li>Ignorance. Not stupidity, but rather lack of understanding of addiction, how it manifests, and it&apos;s consequences. Many don&apos;t realize that addiction is but a
        symptom for other underlying issues. And erred thinking that it is just a matter of willpower and getting one&apos;s act together that can dash the whole
        effort and lead to failure every time. Why don&apos;t you stop doing that? Can&apos;t you see what it&apos;s doing to your children? A logical approach to everything
        but addiction, perhaps.</li>


    <li>Letting the word out. Addict finds out about intervention. If an addict finds out in advance that an intervention is planned, he has plenty of time to foil
        the attempt. He may work on his excuses or a family member&apos;s weak point, or he may choose to not show up at all.
        Getaway Car. Addict knows about the intervention and has a car and driver waiting to whisk him away, avoiding the confrontation altogether.</li>


    <li>Deviates from plan. Allows negotiation. Once a plan is laid out it is absolutely essential that the intervention goes as planned. If an enabling family
        member weakens and feels sympathy for the addict, the addict most likely will use that to his advantage. No addict will ever stop using as long as someone
        enables them to continue on. It&apos;s only through consequences that he will be forced to do that which he would rather not, and that&apos;s go to treatment.
        Once negotiation enters the picture, the intention gets even more muddled. An addict will promise anything; I&apos;ll go to those AA meetings; I&apos;ll see
        that councilor you wanted me to! If I don&apos;t have to work at that place I won&apos;t be stressed, so I won&apos;t have to drink so much! I promise, I swear, trust
        me!</li>

        <br/><div class="groupPic"><img src="pics/dont-give-up.png" alt="people in group" height="45%" width="45%" border="2"></div><br/>


        <li> Family must realize that addicts and alcoholics become master manipulators. That&apos;s how they&apos;ve managed to continue using while turning a blind eye to the
        chaos left in their wake. If sympathy or another ploy seems plausible, he will pull out all stops. Family members must remain firm in their resolve, or
       there is little chance the addict will agree to treatment.</li>


    <li>Untrained Interventionist. If a family member is emotionally attached to the addict, or simply not trained in what to do, chances of success become limited.
        Addicts can be quite volatile when confronted, and a trained professional is ready with an arsenal of rebuttal. Dad may have the hardest line in the
        family, but can he resist if the son threatens suicide? Can he stifle Mom&apos;s sobbing and get back on track? Is the appointed interventionist say someone
        from your church, ready when the meth addict picks up a lamp or starts to throw things? Is he educated enough about addiction to counter the skewed
        rationale? Does he even know how to set the stage to pull the family towards their bottom line? Can he diffuse the addict to keep threats down and
        get him to listen? Can he prevent the addict from leaving? What does he do when the addict flatly refuses all help?</li>

    <li>Professional interventionists are trained in all facets of the process, from quelling enabling to preparing family for what they can expect. He can help
        family members with their impact statements and writing those important bottom line letters. A weak letter is simply ineffective. He&apos;s versed in
        addictions and the psychology that goes with. He knows beforehand what to expect and guides the family to make sure the process goes as smoothly as
        possible.</li>


    <li>Timing. Another area amateurs may not understand. Bags must be packed so that when the intervention is successful, the addict may leave as soon as possible
        to lessen the risk of him changing his mind once he&apos;s had time to think of all the reasons he can&apos;t go. A flight should be booked and the treatment
        center chosen ahead of time. Some don&apos;t realize that there may be a waiting list for treatment, so getting things ready beforehand will eliminate any
        delays.</li>

    <li>Another aspect of timing is for the intervention itself. You don&apos;t want to stage the intervention too early in the day before the alcoholic has his first
        drink as he may be shaky, unfocused, or even combative! You also don&apos;t want to stage the intervention too soon after he&apos;s had some drinks, because he
        may be cloudy or not cognizant. For the binge drinker, the intervention should be staged as soon possible after the last binge so he doesn&apos;t minimize
        his problem. Best to catch him after a particularly bad event to create more impact.Note that it is preferable to send the addict to treatment as far
        away from his home as possible, so he is less distracted by others in his life and is able to concentrate on himself.</li>


    <li>Backing out due to cost of Intervention. Family may stage their own intervention, but truth be told those early effort ts are rarely successful in the long
        run. Trained interventionists are one&apos;s best bet, however, they do charge for their services. While the cost may seem exorbitant to those who have no
        experience with this type of thing, the pay off may be worth it. Usually people have tried all they know to thwart the addict&apos;s resistance, and turn to
        professionals as a last resort. It&apos;s difficult to place a monetary value on the life of someone you love, but addiction is, in the end, a fatal disease.
        Ask yourself if the money is better spent beforehand to save a life, or afterward for funeral expenses.</li>


    <li>Family not on same page. An intervention is a group effort and needs to be coordinated. If everyone is not prepared, then one holdout can throw a wrench in
        the process. Addiction is a family disease and the family often needs treatment themselves. Codependency and dysfunction abound. In codependent
        relationships, people tend to need each other to continue on with what they&apos;re doing. They are more invested in helping the dysfunctional person then
        doing what they should be doing for themselves. Control and preoccupation are hallmarks of the disorder and it is harmful to both the addict and the
        enabler. The main enabler needs to be kept in check to maintain the bottom line.</li>

        <li>Beyond enabling and codependency, comes blame, another distraction tactic. If finger pointing enters the picture it gives the addict ammo in trying to
        avoid the inevitable. Dad drinks, why doesn&apos;t he have to go? What about sis, she uses those pills! I&apos;d be alright if Mom wasn&apos;t having an affair! A
        professional knows how to diffuse these distractions before they jeopardize the intervention. When everyone is on the same page the addict has to face
        reality and hopefully, get into treatment.</li>
