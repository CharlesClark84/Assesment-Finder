    <h2>What An Intervention can help with</h2>
    <p>Drugs rehab
    Alcohol treatment
    Detox centers
    Withdrawal treatments

    You might have tried to convince your loved one to go into rehab for years, but it hasn’t worked. Your efforts might have even pushed your loved one away. But an intervention might be the tool you need to break through and achieve the goal you’re after. An intervention creates a space to honestly and lovingly explain how your loved one’s behavior is affecting you and how he has changed.Instead of nagging or talking in a resentful or angry way, this tactic focuses on feelings and creating awareness for the person who is addicted to drugs or alcohol. When a number of people come together and tell the person the same thing, it can really create awareness.

    It can be beneficial to have a professional help run your intervention. A professional can guide the discussion, encourage the person to open up and can give helpful advice.  Do you know the differences between a 12 step call and an intervention?A drug intervention can help someone realize he is addicted and to what extent. Many people do not realize they are addicted – they simply think they enjoy drugs or alcohol, but don’t realize it is taking over their lives.

    Some people are surrounded by other addicted people, so their behavior seems normal in comparison. During an intervention, they start to see how their lives have changed and how the drug has affected their family life, friend life and work life.

    <h3>The Steps of Drug Intervention The following 9 steps can help you plan for and run your intervention:</h3>

    Stop enabling the person by giving him money, making excuses for him, ignoring his drug problem, paying his bills and other means of enabling. This will only reward and encourage these behaviors. It won’t encourage the person to stop.
    Plan the timing of your intervention. If you can, try to talk to the person when he is not “high” and when everyone is calm and ready to discuss their feelings. Pick a time when you can talk to the person in private, instead of in front of his friends or during an inconvenient time.
    Get the help of a professional if you can. A counselor can help guide the discussion and can help the person with questions.
    During the intervention, be specific with your comments. Give specific examples of how the person’s drug use has affected you.
    Show that you care. Tell your loved one that you care about him and that’s why you are doing this intervention. Express that you want to be there and that you want to support him in finding help.
    Express the consequences of continuing his behavior. Let him know that you are no longer going to enable his drug use, and give specific examples of what will change. Let him know that this is not a punishment, but it is to protect yourself and to get the person to find help. You must follow through with whatever you say.
    Create a group. Interventions work better when a whole group of people is saying the same thing, than if one or two is saying it. Enlist the help of friends, family members and even coworkers or employers to talk to the person. However, only choose people that will be supportive and loving.
    Listen. Instead of bombarding the person, pay attention to what he has to say and if he has any questions. If he starts asking where he would go for treatment or similar questions, he is starting to reach out for help, which is a positive sign. Have him talk to a professional immediately to find the right program.
    If he has agreed to treatment, help him to get there immediately. If you wait, he might change his mind about going. You should already have some of his things packed for him and a plan to bring the person to a treatment program. Top Ten Reasons Interventions Fail
