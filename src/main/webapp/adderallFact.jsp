        <span class="blue">What is adderall:</span>
        Adderall, the trade name for a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, is a medication prescribed for children, teens and adults with an abnormally high level of activity or with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It stimulates the central nervous system, with effects similar to but less potent than amphetamines and more potent than caffeine.

        Adderall has a notably calming effect on hyperactive children and a focusing effect on those with ADHD. When taken as prescribed, Adderall is a valuable medicine. Research has shown that people with ADHD do not get addicted to their stimulant medications at dosages prescribed to them by their doctor. Because of their stimulant properties, however, Adderall and other stimulant medications are misused by some people for whom they are not prescribed

        <span class="blue">Risks of using:</span>
        It is dangerous for anyone to take prescription stimulants not prescribed to them. Short-term effects can include nervousness and insomnia, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, palpitations, headaches, changes in heart rate and blood pressure (usually elevation of both, but occasionally depression), skin rashes and itching, abdominal pain, weight loss, and digestive problems, psychotic episodes, drug dependence and severe depression upon withdrawal.

        High doses of stimulants cause loss of appetite (which may cause serious malnutrition), tremors and muscle twitching, fevers, convulsions, headaches, irregular heartbeat and breathing (which can be life-threatening), anxiety, restlessness, paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions, excessive repetition of movements and meaningless tasks, and the sensation of bugs or worms crawling under the skin.
