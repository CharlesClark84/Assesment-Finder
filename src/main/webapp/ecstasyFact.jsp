        <span class="blue">How is ecstasy used:</span>
        Pills are typically swallowed. They can be crushed up and snorted like the MDMA powder.
        Researchers are studying MDMA in clinical trials as a possible treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety in terminally ill patients, and for social anxiety in autistic adults.

        <span class="blue">Risks of using:</span>
        Effects of using Ecstasy can include involuntary teeth clenching, a loss of inhibitions, nausea, blurred vision, chills and/or sweating. Increases in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as seizures, are also possible. The stimulant effects of the drug enable a person to dance for extended periods, which when combined with the hot crowded conditions usually found at raves, can lead to severe dehydration and hyperthermia (i.e. dramatic increases in body temperature). This can lead to muscle breakdown and kidney, liver and cardiovascular failure. Hyperthermia has also been reported in some of the Ecstasy-related deaths. After-effects can include sleep problems, anxiety and depression.
        When dealing with powder susbstance for any drug it is easy to mix in another product with the drug the could be potentially fatal.
        Repeated use of Ecstasy ultimately may damage the cells that produce the brain chemical serotonin, which has an important role in the regulation of mood, appetite, learning and memory. There is research suggesting Ecstasy use can disrupt or interfere with memory.
