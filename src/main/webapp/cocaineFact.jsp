    <span class="blue">Risks of using:</span>
    Cocaine&apos;s effects are short lived, and once the drug leaves the brain, it leads to a coke crash that includes depression, irritability, and fatigue. Smoking cocaine can produce a particularly aggressive paranoid behavior. When addicted individuals stop using cocaine, they often become depressed. Prolonged cocaine snorting can result in damage of the mucous membrane of the nose.
