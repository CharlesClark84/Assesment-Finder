    <h3><span class="blue">What is Dual Diagnosis</span></h3>
    <div>Mental disorders, such as depression, often accompany an addiction. When co-occurring disorders are present,
        the individual has a dual diagnosis.</div>
    <div>Many people diagnosed with a substance use disorder (SUD) also suffer from a co-occurring mental health or behavioral
        disorder. This is known as a dual diagnosis. Individuals with a dual diagnosis require an integrated treatment plan that
        addresses both disorders as interconnected mental health issues. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health
        (NSDUH), 45 percent of people with addiction have a co-occurring mental health disorder.</div>

    <div>
        <h3><span class="blue">Common mental health disorders linked to substance abuse include the following:</span></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="blue">Attention-deficit hyperactive disorder(ADHD)</span>

                People with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be more inclined to abuse substances as a way to cope with their symptoms. Many people are prescribed stimulants to treat their ADHD, which can be habit-forming and lead to a toxic pattern of substance abuse.
            </li>
            <li><span class="blue">Bipolar Disorder</span>

                About half of people with bipolar disorder also struggle with addiction. As with any other disorder, it can be tempting to self-medicate. Drugs and alcohol provide a source of temporary relief from emotional situations and manic episodes for people with bipolar.
            </li>
            <li><span class="blue">Borderline Personality Disorder</span>

                Studies have shown that addiction and borderline personality disorder (BPD) often occur together. Over two-thirds of people with BPD have turned toward substance abuse at some point in their lives.
            </li>
            <li><span class="blue">Depression</span>

                An estimated one in 10 adults in the United States have reported suffering from depression. Many people diagnosed with depression try to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol. This often makes the problem worse. The crash after the high can be devastating for those with a pre-existing depressive condition.
            </li>
            <li><span class="blue">Eating Disorders</span>

                Eating disorders often stem from strong feelings of inferiority. Drugs that suppress appetite are especially common among people with these disorders
            </li>
            <li><span class="blue">Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</span>

                The most common mental condition in the U.S., generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) affects 18 percent of the adult population. People who suffer from GAD may be more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol to manage their symptoms. People may also abuse benzodiazepines, which are highly addictive prescription medications used to treat anxiety disorders.
            </li>
            <li><span class="blue">Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</span>

                Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) causes a number of unwanted obsessions and compulsions, such as an irrational fear of germs and the need to constantly clean. There are many variations of this illness. People with OCD often suffer from anxiety and depression as a result of their involuntary behavior, which can lead to substance abuse.
            </li>
            <li><span class="blue">Post-traumatic stress disorder</span>

                When a person develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) their brain produces less endorphins than a healthy brain, making them more likely to turn toward alcohol or drugs to feel happy. According to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, nearly 75 percent of soldiers and veterans who experience a traumatic or violent event during combat report repetitive alcohol abuse.
            </li>
            <li><span class="blue">Schizophrenia</span>

                Schizophrenia is characterized by hallucinations and delusional thinking. Diagnosing schizophrenia alongside an addiction can be difficult because both conditions share the same effects. When a person has schizophrenia and uses substances as a way to self-medicate their condition, they risk putting their health further at risk.
