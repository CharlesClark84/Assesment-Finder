        <span class="blue">What is ketamine:</span>
        Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used in human anesthesia and veterinary medicine. Dissociative drugs are hallucinogens that cause a person to feel detached from reality. Much of the ketamine sold on the street has been diverted from veterinarians’ offices. The drug is similar to PCP

        <span class="blue">How is ketamine used:</span>
        Ketamine is snorted or swallowed. It is odorless and tasteless, so it can be added to beverages without being detected, and it induces amnesia. Because it has been used to commit sexual assaults due to its ability to sedate and incapacitate unsuspecting victims, ketamine is also considered to be a “date rape” drug.

        <span class="blue">Risks of using:</span>
        Some ketamine experiences involve a terrifying feeling of almost complete sensory detachment that is likened to a near-death experience. These experiences, similar to a “bad trip” on LSD, are called the “K-hole.” Low-dose intoxication from ketamine results in impaired attention, learning ability, and memory. In high doses, ketamine can cause delirium, amnesia, impaired motor function, high blood pressure, depression, and potentially fatal respiratory problems.

        Flashbacks have been reported several weeks after ketamine is used. Prolonged use may also cause agitation, depression, cognitive difficulties, unconsciousness, and amnesia
