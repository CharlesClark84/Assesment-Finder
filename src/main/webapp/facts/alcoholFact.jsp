    What are the risks?
    Alcohol lowers inhibitions and impairs judgment and coordination. It can also increase the incidence of aggressive or violent acts. Consuming large enough quantities in a short period of time – or binge drinking, which is defined as 4-5 drinks in two hours or less – can cause alcohol poisoning and even death, often by choking on vomit, which leads to asphyxiation (a lack of oxygen that causes suffocation).
    Prolonged, heavy use of alcohol can lead to addiction (alcoholism), liver and heart disease, and other health consequences such as a weakened immune system and increased risk of developing certain cancers
